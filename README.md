# CVE-2024-32002 Submodule
A submodule to demonstrate CVE-2024-32002. Demonstrates Remote Code Execution (RCE) by loading a malicious commit hook into the `.git` directory of the parent repo.

See [cve-2024-32002-poc-rce](https://github.com/JakobTheDev/cve-2024-32002-poc-rce) for the working POC that utilises this repo.

## What this repo contains
- A malicous git hook called `post-checkout` which runs immediately after the clone completes. This git hook simply pops calc in Windows or MacOS.
- The git hook is located under notexists/hooks for good reason:
	- notexists is needed to make sure the repo clones into an empty directory.
	- hooks is the directory that git looks for git hooks to execute.
